# YC Application Summary - Change Order Copilot

## Executive Summary

**Product**: Subcontractor-first Change Order Notice Generator  
**Target User**: Electrical subcontractor PMs/foremen (10-100 person companies)  
**Core Value**: Transform field notes/photos into contract-compliant notices in under 2 minutes  
**Problem**: Subcontractors lose money when scope changes aren't documented correctly and quickly

## The Opportunity

### Market Size
- **$1.7 trillion** US construction industry
- **700,000+** subcontractor companies in the US
- **Millions lost annually** due to improper change order documentation

### The Problem
1. **Incentive mismatch**: Most tools serve GCs/owners, not subs
2. **Time pressure**: Notice windows typically 48-72 hours
3. **Complexity**: Contract requirements are confusing and vary by project
4. **Consequences**: Miss the deadline = waive your right to payment

### Why Now?
- Subcontractors increasingly tech-savvy (smartphones on every jobsite)
- Rising construction costs make change order disputes more expensive
- Labor shortages mean less time for paperwork
- Digital documentation becoming standard

## The Solution

### What We Built (MVP)
A single-page web app that:
1. Accepts field photos (1-5 images)
2. Accepts brief description (voice or text)
3. Parses uploaded contract PDF
4. Generates contract-compliant notice with:
   - Formal structure
   - Contract clause citations
   - Timestamped photo evidence
   - Professional formatting
5. Outputs downloadable PDF + email-ready format

### What We Deliberately Did NOT Build
- ❌ User accounts
- ❌ Procore integration
- ❌ Workflow states/approvals
- ❌ Billing system
- ❌ Multi-project dashboard
- ❌ Real-time collaboration

**Why?** Prove core value first. Everything else is distraction.

## Differentiation

### vs. Procore/PlanGrid/Autodesk
- **They**: Serve GCs, focus on project management
- **We**: Serve subs, focus on legal protection
- **Angle**: "I got paid faster / I avoided a dispute"

### vs. Generic Document Templates
- **They**: Static templates, manual clause lookup
- **We**: Auto-extract clauses, timestamp evidence, deterministic output
- **Angle**: "Contract-compliant in 2 minutes, not 2 hours"

### vs. Lawyers/Consultants
- **They**: Expensive, slow, after-the-fact
- **We**: Free/cheap, instant, preventative
- **Angle**: "Preserve your rights before it's too late"

## Business Model (Future)

### Phase 1: Freemium
- Free: 5 notices/month
- Pro ($49/month): Unlimited notices, priority support
- Team ($199/month): Multi-user, analytics

### Phase 2: Platform
- Marketplace for templates ($)
- Integration fees (Procore, etc.)
- White-label for large subs

### Phase 3: Network Effects
- GC portal (receive/respond to notices)
- Dispute resolution marketplace
- Payment tracking and enforcement

## Traction Plan

### Week 1-2: User Interviews
- Target: 20 electrical sub PMs
- Goal: "I would use this on my current job"
- Channels: LinkedIn, trade associations, jobsite visits

### Week 3-4: Beta Testing
- Target: 5 active users
- Goal: 50 notices generated
- Metric: Time saved, disputes avoided

### Month 2-3: Paid Pilots
- Target: 3 paying companies
- Goal: $1,000 MRR
- Validate: Willingness to pay

### Month 4-6: Expand
- Add 2-3 more trades (HVAC, plumbing)
- Build template library
- Add voice-to-text

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Direct Outreach
- LinkedIn messages to sub PMs
- Trade show booths (ABC, ASA)
- Jobsite demos (show up with iPad)

### Phase 2: Content Marketing
- "How to protect yourself from change order disputes"
- "The $50K mistake: Missing your notice deadline"
- SEO for "change order notice template"

### Phase 3: Partnerships
- Trade associations (NECA, IEC)
- Insurance companies (risk reduction)
- Bonding companies (fewer claims)

## Team (Future Needs)

### Immediate (Post-YC)
- **Technical co-founder**: Mobile app, ML for contract parsing
- **Sales/BD**: Relationships with trade associations
- **Customer success**: Onboarding, support

### 12-18 Months
- **Legal advisor**: Ensure compliance across jurisdictions
- **Product designer**: Mobile-first experience
- **Engineers**: Scale, integrations

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Adoption
- **Risk**: Subs resistant to new tools
- **Mitigation**: Focus on pain (lost money), make it stupid simple

### Risk 2: Legal Liability
- **Risk**: Users blame us if notice is rejected
- **Mitigation**: Clear disclaimers, insurance, legal review

### Risk 3: Competition
- **Risk**: Procore adds this feature
- **Mitigation**: Move fast, own the sub relationship, better UX

### Risk 4: Contract Variability
- **Risk**: Too many contract types to parse
- **Mitigation**: Start with one trade, one contract type (AIA)

## Success Metrics

### MVP Validation (Now)
- ✅ 10+ user interviews
- ✅ 3+ "I would use this" quotes
- ✅ Working demo

### 3 Months
- 50+ active users
- 500+ notices generated
- $1,000+ MRR

### 6 Months
- 200+ active users
- 3,000+ notices generated
- $10,000+ MRR
- 1+ documented dispute avoided

### 12 Months
- 1,000+ active users
- 20,000+ notices generated
- $50,000+ MRR
- 10+ documented disputes avoided
- Expand to 3+ trades

## Why This Can Be a Big Company

### 1. Massive Market
- 700K+ subcontractors in US
- Average company has 5-10 PMs/foremen
- 3.5M+ potential users

### 2. High Willingness to Pay
- Avoiding one dispute pays for years of subscription
- ROI is obvious and immediate
- Budget comes from "insurance" not "software"

### 3. Network Effects
- More subs → GCs need to use it
- More GCs → More subs need to use it
- Data → Better templates, better outcomes

### 4. Expansion Opportunities
- All trades (not just electrical)
- All change management (not just notices)
- All construction disputes (not just change orders)

### 5. Defensibility
- Domain expertise (construction law + workflow)
- Data moat (templates, outcomes)
- Network effects (sub-GC marketplace)

## The Ask (YC)

### What We Need
1. **Validation**: Are we solving a real problem?
2. **Distribution**: How do we reach subs at scale?
3. **Network**: Intros to construction tech investors/advisors
4. **Focus**: What to build next?

### What We'll Do
- 100% focus on user interviews and iteration
- Ship weekly updates based on feedback
- Build what users need, not what we think is cool
- Measure everything: time saved, disputes avoided, money recovered

## Conclusion

**The problem is real**: Subcontractors lose money on undocumented changes.

**The user is desperate**: Missing notice deadlines means waiving payment rights.

**The product does something new**: First tool built FOR subs, focused on legal protection.

**This can be a big company**: Massive market, clear expansion path, network effects.

**We're ready to build**: Working MVP, clear vision, ready to iterate.
