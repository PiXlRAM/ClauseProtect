# Demo Guide for YC Application

## 60-90 Second Silent Demo Script

### Setup (Before Recording)
1. Have 2-3 field photos ready (construction site, electrical work, etc.)
2. Have a sample contract PDF ready (or use a generic subcontractor agreement)
3. Open the app at http://localhost:3000

### Demo Flow (Record This)

**Scene 1: Landing Page (5 seconds)**
- Show the clean, professional interface
- Headline: "Change Order Copilot - From field notes to contract-compliant notice in under 2 minutes"

**Scene 2: Fill Project Info (10 seconds)**
- Type project name: "Downtown Office Building"
- Type GC name: "ABC Construction Co."

**Scene 3: Upload Contract (10 seconds)**
- Click contract upload area
- Select PDF file
- Show green checkmark confirmation

**Scene 4: Upload Photos (15 seconds)**
- Click photo upload area
- Select 2-3 photos
- Show thumbnails with timestamps appearing

**Scene 5: Add Description (10 seconds)**
- Type: "Additional conduit runs required due to unforeseen structural conflicts discovered during rough-in"

**Scene 6: Generate Notice (5 seconds)**
- Click "Generate Notice" button
- Show loading state briefly

**Scene 7: Preview Generated Notice (20 seconds)**
- Scroll through the generated notice showing:
  - Professional header with date/time
  - Project information
  - Description of change
  - **Contract clause citations** (highlighted)
  - **Timestamped photo evidence**
  - Request for direction
  - Reservation of rights

**Scene 8: Actions (10 seconds)**
- Click "Download PDF" button
- Click "Email to GC" button (shows email client opening)
- Show the final PDF opened

**Scene 9: Close (5 seconds)**
- Show "New Notice" button to demonstrate repeatability

### Key Points to Highlight Visually

1. **Speed**: The entire process takes under 2 minutes
2. **Contract Compliance**: Auto-extracted clauses with section numbers
3. **Evidence Preservation**: Locked timestamps on photos
4. **Professional Output**: Looks like something a senior PM would send
5. **Simplicity**: One page, clear workflow, no complexity

### What Makes This Demo Powerful

- **No talking needed**: The UI is self-explanatory
- **Boring is good**: Lawyers and PMs want boring, predictable documents
- **Solves real pain**: Missing notice deadlines = losing money
- **Immediate value**: Works on day one, no setup required

### YC Application Talking Points

After showing the demo, emphasize:

1. **Problem is real**: Subcontractors lose millions annually due to improper change order documentation
2. **User is desperate**: Notice windows are typically 48-72 hours; miss it and you waive your right to payment
3. **Product does something new**: First tool built FOR subs, not GCs; focuses on legal protection, not project management
4. **Can become big**: $1.7T construction industry, 700K+ subcontractors in US alone

### User Validation Quote Template

"I've lost money because I didn't send something like this in time."
- OR -
"I would use this on my current job."
- OR -
"This would've saved me last month."

### Next Steps After MVP Validation

1. Voice-to-text for field notes
2. Template library for common changes
3. Email integration (direct send)
4. Multi-project management
5. Team collaboration
6. Cost/schedule impact tracking
7. Integration with Procore/other PM tools

## Recording Tips

- Use screen recording software (OBS, Loom, etc.)
- Record at 1920x1080 resolution
- Keep cursor movements smooth and deliberate
- Pause briefly on important sections (contract clauses, timestamps)
- Export as MP4 or upload to YouTube/Loom

## Demo Data Suggestions

**Project Names:**
- Downtown Office Building
- Medical Center Expansion
- Warehouse Distribution Facility

**GC Names:**

## Why This MVP is Enough

YC is checking:
- ✅ **Is the problem real?** Yes - subcontractors lose money on undocumented changes
- ✅ **Is the user desperate?** Yes - missing notice = waiving payment rights
- ✅ **Does the product do something new?** Yes - first sub-focused tool for change order protection
- ✅ **Can this become a big company?** Yes - massive market, clear expansion path

This MVP answers all four questions clearly and concisely.
